# Redis Enterprise Solutions Architects Repository

Welcome to the Redis Enterprise Solutions Architects Repository. This repository is a collection of demonstrations, proofs of concepts, and experimental code developed by our team of Solution Architects. It is intended to provide our customers and prospects with a deeper understanding of our products and their potential applications.

*Please note that the code contained in this repository is not officially supported or product-approved code.* It is designed for demonstration purposes and should not be used as a guide for setting up a production environment. The code here is experimental and may not follow best practices for production-level code.

For advice on setting up a production environment, we strongly recommend referring to [our Official Redis Enterprise documentation](https://docs.redis.com/latest/index.html). This comprehensive documentation provides detailed instructions and best practices for deploying and managing Redis in a production setting.

If you are a customer and need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact your Solution Architect or support partners. They have the necessary knowledge and resources to provide advice and support.

Remember, the code in this repository is meant to inspire and demonstrate what's possible. It's a starting point for your own exploration and innovation. We hope you find it useful and look forward to seeing what you build with Redis. We are also interested in any improvements or updates you might have found in your exploration, so please engage with us, reach out, or submit a Pull Request.

Happy coding!
